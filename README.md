[Computer Science vs. Software Engineering: 10 Key Differences](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/computer-science-vs-software-engineering)

I choose this article because the difference between computer science and software engineering have always been a question that I was uncertain with before this class and is the topic a lot of people concerned about. It is interesting that it, as an employment website, actually includes and explains all my questions from different perspectives like core educational studies, career paths, scientific theories. I like how it expressed that “While software engineers might develop, build, test and evaluate software and its applications, computer scientists use computer languages, statistics and other mathematics to theorize on the most effective ways to develop, program and apply software”.
